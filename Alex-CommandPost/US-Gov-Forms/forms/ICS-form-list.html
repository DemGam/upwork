		<div class="form__title txt-bold txt-left">INTRODUCTION TO ICS FORMS</div>
		<p class="paragraph">The National Incident Management System (NIMS) Incident Command System (ICS) Forms Booklet,
			FEMA 502-2, is
			designed to assist emergency response personnel in the use of ICS and corresponding documentation during incident
			operations. This booklet is a companion document to the NIMS ICS Field Operations Guide (FOG), FEMA 502-1, which
			provides general guidance to emergency responders on implementing ICS. This booklet is meant to complement
			existing
			incident management programs and does not replace relevant emergency operations plans, laws, and ordinances. These
			forms are designed for use within the Incident Command System, and are not targeted for use in Area Command or in
			multiagency coordination systems.
		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">These forms are intended for use as tools for the creation of Incident Action Plans (IAPs), for
			other incident
			management
			activities, and for support and documentation of ICS activities. Personnel using the forms should have a basic
			understanding of NIMS, including ICS, through training and/or experience to ensure they can effectively use and
			understand these forms. These ICS Forms represent an all-hazards approach and update to previously used ICS Forms.
			While the layout and specific blocks may have been updated, the functionality of the forms remains the same. It is
			recommended that all users familiarize themselves with the updated forms and instructions.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">A general description of each ICS Form’s purpose, suggested preparation, and distribution are
			included immediately after
			the form, including block-by-block completion instructions to ensure maximum clarity on specifics, or for those
			personnel
			who may be unfamiliar with the forms.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">The ICS organizational charts contained in these forms are examples of how an ICS organization
			is typically developed
			for incident response. However, the flexibility and scalability of ICS allow modifications, as needed, based on
			experience
			and particular incident requirements.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">These forms are designed to include the essential data elements for the ICS process they
			address. The use of these
			standardized ICS Forms is encouraged to promote consistency in the management and documentation of incidents in
			the
			spirit of NIMS, and to facilitate effective use of mutual aid. In many cases, additional pages can be added to the
			existing
			ICS Forms when needed, and several forms are set up with this specific provision. The section after the ICS Forms
			List
			provides details on adding appendixes or fields to the forms for jurisdiction- or discipline-specific needs.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">It may be appropriate to compile and maintain other NIMS-related forms with these ICS Forms,
			such as resource
			management and/or ordering forms that are used to support incidents. Examples of these include the following
			Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) forms: REQ-A (Interstate Mutual Aid Request), Reimbursement
			Form R-1 (Interstate Reimbursement Form), and Reimbursement Form R-2 (Intrastate Reimbursement Form).</p>

		<div class="form__title txt-bold txt-left">ICS FORM ADAPTION, EXTENSION, AND APPENDIXES</div>
		<p class="paragraph">The ICS Forms in this booklet are designed to serve all-hazards, cross-discipline needs for
			incident management across
			the Nation. These forms include the essential data elements for the ICS process they address, and create a
			foundation
			within ICS for complex incident management activities. However, the flexibility and scalability of NIMS should
			allow for
			needs outside this foundation, so the following are possible mechanisms to add to, extend, or adapt ICS Forms when
			needed.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Because the goal of NIMS is to have a consistent nationwide approach to incident management,
			jurisdictions and
			disciplines are encouraged to use the ICS Forms as they are presented here – unless these forms do not meet an
			organization’s particular incident management needs for some unique reason. If changes are needed, the focus on
			essential information elements should remain, and as such the spirit and intent of particular fields or
			“information
			elements” on the ICS Forms should remain intact to maintain consistency if the forms are altered. Modifications
			should
			be
			clearly indicated as deviations from or additions to the ICS Forms. The following approaches may be used to meet
			any
			unique needs.</p>
		<div class="page__title txt-bold">ICS Form Adaptation</div>
		<p class="paragraph">When agencies and organizations require specialized forms or information for particular kinds
			of incidents,
			events, or
			disciplines, it may be beneficial to utilize the essential data elements from a particular ICS Form to create a
			more
			localized
			or field-specific form. When this occurs, organizations are encouraged to use the relevant essential data elements
			and
			ICS Form number, but to clarify that the altered form is a specific organizational adaptation of the form. For
			example,
			an
			altered form should clearly indicate in the title that it has been changed to meet a specific need, such as “ICS
			215A,
			Hazard Risk Analysis Worksheet, Adapted for Story County Hazmat Program.”</p>

		<div class="page__title txt-bold">Extending ICS Form Fields</div>
		<p class="paragraph">Particular fields on an ICS Form may need to include further breakouts or additional related
			elements. If such additions
			are needed, the form itself should be clearly labeled as an adapted form (see above), and the additional sub-field
			numbers should be clearly labeled as unique to the adapted form. Letters or other indicators may be used to label
			the
			new sub-fields (if the block does not already include sub-fields).</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Examples of possible field additions are shown below for the ICS 209:</p>
		<div class="mb-1">
			<ul class="disc-list">
				<li>Block 2: Incident Number.
					<ul class="disc-list">
						<li>Block 2A (adapted): Full agency accounting cost charge number for primary authority having jurisdiction.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Block 29: Primary Materials or Hazards Involved (hazardous chemicals, fuel types, infectious agents,
					radiation,
					etc.).
					<ul class="disc-list">
						<li>Block 29A (adapted): Indicate specific wildland fire fuel model number.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="page__title txt-bold">Creating ICS Form Appendixes</div>
		<p class="paragraph">Certain ICS Forms may require appendixes to include additional information elements needed by a
			particular jurisdiction
			or discipline. When an appendix is needed for a given form, it is expected that the jurisdiction or discipline
			will
			determine
			standardized fields for such an appendix and make the form available as needed.

		</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Any ICS Form appendixes should be clearly labeled with the form name and an indicator that it
			is a discipline- or
			jurisdiction-specific appendix. Appendix field numbering should begin following the last identified block in the
			corresponding ICS Form.</p>
