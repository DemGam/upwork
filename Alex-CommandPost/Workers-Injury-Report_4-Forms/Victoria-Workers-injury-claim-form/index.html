						<h4 class="chapter-title">Collection of personal and health information to manage your claim*</h4>

						<p>In processing your claim, the Victorian WorkCover Authority (WorkSafe) and any WorkSafe Agent acting for
							WorkSafe in relation to your claim may collect personal and health information about you. WorkSafe and its
							Agents are required by law to ensure that all people about whom they collect personal and health
							information are provided with the following information:</p>
						<p>WorkSafe is a body corporate established under the Victorian workers’ compensation legislation. Agents
							are appointed by WorkSafe under that legislation to act on its behalf in managing workers’ compensation
							policies and claims for compensation.</p>
						<p>Personal and health information about you is collected on this form and may also be collected during the
							processing, assessing and management of your claim. It may be collected from your current, previous and
							future employers, other government agencies, credit reporting agencies, health service providers and other
							persons who can provide information relevant to the claim.</p>
						<p>Personal and health information about you may also be collected by solicitors, private investigators,
							loss adjusters and other service providers acting on behalf of WorkSafe or your employer’s Agent. Personal
							and health information collected about you is used for the purpose of processing, assessing and managing
							your claim and to verify any evidence you may submit in support of the claim. The information may also be
							used for one or more of the purposes listed in Victorian workers’ compensation legislation for the
							purposes of legal proceedings arising under that legislation, to assist with your rehabilitation and
							return to work and to assist WorkSafe and Agents to better manage claims generally.</p>
						<p>For the purposes of processing, assessing and managing your claim, WorkSafe and your employer’s Agent may
							disclose personal and health information about you to each other and to the following types of
							organisations:</p>

						<ul class="list list_spaced mb-5">
							<li>Employees, contractors and agents of WorkSafe and Agents</li>
							<li>Your employers</li>
							<li>Solicitors, medical practitioners and other health service providers, private investigators, loss
								adjusters and other service providers acting on behalf of WorkSafe or the Agent in relation to the claim
							</li>
							<li>The Workplace Injury Commission and Medical Panels</li>
							<li>Any committee established under legislation to advise WorkSafe</li>
							<li>A court or tribunal in the course of criminal proceedings or any proceedings under any of the Acts
								which WorkSafe administers</li>
							<li>Any other person, organisation or government agency authorised by you, or by law, to obtain the
								information.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Collection of this information may be required by Victorian workers’ compensation legislation. If you do
							not provide any part or all of this information, your claim may not be accepted or processed. You may
							request access to personal and health information about you collected by WorkSafe or your employer’s Agent
							by contacting your employer’s Agent.</p>

						<div class="card grey-10 mb-2">
							<h4 class="chapter-title">Communicating with you</h4>
							<p>WorkSafe may use your email address or mobile telephone number for any purpose for which you provide
								it, including to send you personal and health information relating to your claim. Email and SMS are
								convenient and consistent methods of communication, but you should understand that they are not
								completely secure and there is a risk that they could be intercepted, read or modiﬁed by others or sent
								to an incorrect address. If you have any questions, or if you would like to update your contact details
								or change your preferences for how WorkSafe communicates with you, please contact us via the “Contact
								us” page on the WorkSafe website: <a class="link" href="https://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au"
									target="_blank">worksafe.vic.gov.au.</a></p>
						</div>

						<p>WorkSafe’s policies for managing personal and health information are set out in its Privacy Policy, which
							is available from your nearest WorkSafe office or at the WorkSafe website at <a class="link"
								href="https://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au" target="_blank">worksafe.vic.gov.au.</a>
							Information relating to your right to access your WorkSafe claim information is also available at the
							website.</p>
						<p class="mb-2">(*References to ‘your claim’ include any provisional payments you may be entitled to. If
							your employer is
							an approved self-insurer, references to ‘WorkSafe’ and ‘Agent’ should be read as if they were references
							to ‘self-insurer’ and ‘approved agent of a self-insurer’.)</p>

						<div class="card grey-10">
							<h4 class="chapter-title">Calculating your entitlement to weekly payments</h4>
							<p>Weekly payments are calculated based on your pre-injury average weekly earnings (PIAWE), generally in
								the 52 weeks before your injury. If you have been with your employer for less than 52 weeks, your PIAWE
								will be your average weekly earnings in the period of actual employment.</p>
							<p class="txt-bold">What information your employer needs to provide about your earnings</p>
							<p>To enable the WorkSafe Agent to calculate your PIAWE, your employer will need to provide
								details of the
								following payments made to you in the past 52 weeks of your employment, or if that was less than 52
								weeks, in the period of your actual employment.</p>

							<ul class="list list_spaced mb-2">
								<li>Base rate of pay</li>
								<li>Overtime and shift allowances</li>
								<li>Piece rates, tally bonuses and commissions</li>
								<li>Non-pecuniary beneﬁts including residential accommodation, use of a motor vehicle, payment of health
									insurance or payment of education fees</li>
								<li>Any salary sacriﬁce arrangements</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Your employer will also need to tell the Agent if, in the 52 week period before the injury, your
								earnings increased due to a promotion, or if they decreased due to you voluntarily reducing your hours
								or changing the nature of your work with the employer.</p>
							<p>If your earnings include any other items not listed above, please discuss this with your Agent.</p>
