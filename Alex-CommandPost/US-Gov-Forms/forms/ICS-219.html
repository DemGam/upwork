		<p class="paragraph"><span class="paragraph__title txt-bold">Purpose.</span>Resource Status Cards (ICS 219) are also
			known as “T-Cards,” and are used by the Resources Unit to record
			status and location information on resources, transportation, and support vehicles and personnel. These cards
			provide a
			visual display of the status and location of resources assigned to the incident.</p>
		<p class="paragraph"><span class="paragraph__title txt-bold">Preparation.</span>Information to be placed on the
			cards may be obtained from several sources including, but not limited to:</p>
		<ul class="mb-1 disc-list">
			<li>Incident Briefing (ICS 201). </li>
			<li>Incident Check-In List (ICS 211).</li>
			<li>General Message (ICS 213).</li>
			<li>Agency-supplied information or electronic resource management systems.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="paragraph"><span class="paragraph__title txt-bold">Distribution.</span>ICS 219s are displayed in resource
			status or “T-Card” racks where they can be easily viewed, retrieved,
			updated, and rearranged. The Resources Unit typically maintains cards for resources assigned to an incident until
			demobilization. At demobilization, all cards should be turned in to the Documentation Unit.</p>
		<p class="paragraph"><span class="paragraph__title txt-bold">Notes.</span>There are eight different status
			cards (see list below) and a header card, to be printed front-to-back on cardstock.
			Each card is printed on a different color of cardstock and used for a different resource category/kind/type. The
			format
			and
			content of information on each card varies depending upon the intended use of the card.</p>
